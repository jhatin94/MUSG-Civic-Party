            <div class="header">Who Are We?</div>
            <div id="history">We are a Party made up of members across the political spectrum that generally oppose authoritarianism and support individual and State rights. The Party was founded upon a common distaste of all the current political parties in ModelUSGov. 
            Check out our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelUSGov/wiki/civic">Reddit Wiki Page</a> for more info.</div>
            <div class="header">Our Leadership Team</div>
            <div id="leadership">
                <p>
                    The Party is led by the National Civic Committee, which is made up of the Chairman, 2 Deputy Chairmen, the Head Recruiter, and the Chair of the Platform Maintainence Committee.
                    The NCC keeps up with Party functions such as primary, replacement, and party elections. Additionally, the NCC implements the electoral strategy of the Party.
                </p>
                <p>                    
                    The Platform Maintenance Committee (PMC) is the body which writes all policy for the party platform. The members are elected every three months, and are led by the PMC Chairman. If you have any ideas for policy, please PM the Chairman /u/bomalia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Recruitment Committee is the main body in charge of increasing party membership and reaching out to potential new members. The Chief Recruiter is appointed by the Chairman, and has the authority to appoint up to four Junior Recruiters to fill out the committee.
                    It is also in charge of advertising and public relations for the party, and looks for appropriate subreddits to reach out to as a result. The committee is headed by Chief Recruiter /u/Vakiadia.
