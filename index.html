            <div id="history" class="infoText">
                We are a Party made up of members across the political spectrum that generally oppose authoritarianism and support individual and State rights. The Party was founded upon a common distaste of all the current political parties in ModelUSGov.
                Our Party's logo is an eagle and our colors are light purple and white. Check out our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelUSGov/wiki/civic">Reddit Wiki Page</a> for more info.

            <div class="smallHeader">Our Leadership Team</div>
            <div id="leadership" class="infoText">
                <p>
                    The Party is led by the National Civic Committee (NCC), which is made up of the Chairman, 2 Deputy Chairmen, the Head Recruiter, and the Chair of the Platform Maintainence Committee.
                    The NCC keeps up with Party functions such as primary, replacement, and party elections. Additionally, the NCC implements the electoral strategy of the Party.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Platform Maintenance Committee (PMC) is the body which writes all policy for the party platform. The members are elected every three months, and are led by the PMC Chairman. If you have any ideas for policy, get in touch with them!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Recruitment Committee is the main body in charge of increasing party membership and reaching out to potential new members. The Chief Recruiter is appointed by the Chairman, and has the authority to appoint up to four Junior Recruiters to fill out the committee.
                    It is also in charge of advertising and public relations for the party, and looks for appropriate subreddits to reach out to as a result.

                <div class="platSecText">
                    The free market, adequately regulated, is a powerful tool that may be used to harness the work and innovation of our people for the common good. Regulations to ensure efficient market function and to correct market failures, are ways that the the market can be harnessed to serve the people.
                    In general, government should refrain from regulation unless an opportunity for improvement is clear. As economics is continuing to develop with new findings each year, the Civic Party is not wed to any single theory, but will consider the most current science and evidence with respect to any policy.
                    We support free trade and global markets for goods and services, with few exceptions. We support regulations to offset cost shifting, reduce information costs, and prevent burdensome monopolies. We also support targeted measures to subsidize strategic industries and innovations, where warranted.
                    In short, we support economic policies that will make our nation strong and our people rich.
                </div>
                <div class="platSecTitle">Minimum Wage</div>
                <div class="platSecText">
                    The Civic Party does not call for the abolition of the federal minimum wage. In accordance with our beliefs on the role of the federal government, we believe that the States should take the lead with tying their minimum wages to local inflation levels, rather than increasing minimum wage at the federal level and increasing unemployment.

                <div class="platSecTitle">Immigration</div>
                <div class="platSecText">
                    The Civic Party holds that America is a nation of immigrants, and the many cultures and peoples who make up the US is a positive, as it encourages discourse and democracy. Therefore, the Party advocates for further reformation of the immigration process, making it much easier for immigrants to apply and receive visas.
                    Furthermore, the Party supports the gradual decrease of immigration quotas, with the ultimate goal of completely abolishing quotas. The sooner a person can come to the United States and become a working member of society the better. This entails paying taxes and working in the US.
                </div>
                <div class="platSecTitle">Illegal Immigrants</div>
                <div class="platSecText">
                    Hard working, non-violent, illegal immigrants who have assimilated into our communities should be given a path to legal residency and citizenship. If they have lived here for at least seven years and have committed no crime more serious than their illegal residency they should have the opportunity for permanent residency and naturalization.
                    Special consideration should be given to those that were brought here at a young age.

                <div class="platSecTitle">Federalism</div>
                <div class="platSecText">
                    We believe that not only is a decentralized federal government more efficient, but it is also more democratic to leave many affairs to the respective states and municipalities that make up our nation. 
                    This includes a commitment to letting states create and maintain their own quality education systems without federal interference.

                <div class="platSecTitle">Firearms</div>
                <div class="platSecText">
                    We stand in support of Second Amendment rights, however we support common-sense regulations such as background checks for those seeking to purchase a firearm.
                </div>
                <div class="platSecTitle">Drugs</div>
                <div class="platSecText">
                    As with most things, we believe that this should ultimately be left up to the states, however we support legalization and taxation of drugs on a state level.
                </div>
                <div class="platSecTitle">Same-Sex Marriage</div>
                <div class="platSecText">
                    We generally believe that the state should be taken out of marriage, with civil unions available to same-sex couples and heterosexual couples alike.
                </div>
                <div class="platSecTitle">Campaign Finance Reform</div>
                <div class="platSecText">
                    We support a public system of campaign finance to ensure a multitude of voices are heard in the political process, and we advocate for the passage of the Udall amendment.
                </div>
                <div class="platSecTitle">Death Penalty</div>
                <div class="platSecText">
                    The Civic Party is against the usage of the death penalty in non-military courts. We believe that the death penalty represents a gross overreach of state power, and that the state, being fallible, should not have that power. 
                    Furthermore, while a civil code and law enforcement is vital to the maintenance of a functioning society, innocents being killed for the crimes of others, only serves to degrade the trust of the people in the state.
                </div>
                <div class="platSecTitle">Entitlements</div>
                <div class="platSecText">
                    We believe in maintaining Social Security and Medicare in order to preserve the independence of our seniors, to protect the disabled in our society, and to show our commitment to our fellow citizens.
                </div>
                <div class="platSecTitle">Environment</div>
                <div class="platSecText">
                    We support not only the notion that Global Climate Change is indeed real and caused by man, but we also support regulations or other schemes to help protect our environment and preserve it for future generations to make use of.

                <div class="platSecTitle">Philosophy</div>
                <div class="platSecText">
                    The Civic Party calls for an active American foreign policy consisting of the defense of American interests, through diplomacy, economics, and if necessary, military force. Oftentimes American interests go undefended due to a lack of interest in diplomacy or the refusal to use the US economy as a policy tool. 
                    The United States should at all costs avoid foreign engagements when a coalition is not able to be formed. If the United States’ allies refuse to join the United States in a military endeavor it is likely that the goal is not important enough to warrant use of force, or misguided to begin with. 
                    Furthermore, when military force is used, it must be used with clear and achievable goals for military force. The United States must firmly stand behind her allies against tyrants and revanchist states, which seek to destabilize and assert more dominance over their region. 
                    NATO commitments must be upheld, and the US needs to show that it cannot be swayed by regional powers, only with these shows of force can the principle of deterrence be showed to foreign aggressors. Bilateral and multilateral military alliances should be defensive in nature and undertaken with the greatest of care, only entered with true American allies, who will align consistently with the maintenance of US interest.
                </div>
                <div class="platSecTitle">Defense</div>
                <div class="platSecText">
                    Maintaining our position as the world's sole superpower is important for the security of the world. While wherever possible we wish to work with our allies in coalition, the world relies on our strength and resolve to deter those that would disturb global peace. Our military should maintain adequate nuclear and conventional forces to be effective deterrents as well as maintain leadership in new security technologies, such as drone- and cyber-warfare capabilities.
                </div>
                <div class="platSecTitle">The UN and International Law</div>
                <div class="platSecText">
                    We support the United Nations and its' current composition. The non-binding nature of the United Nations is a feature, rather than a bug, which ensures territorial and national sovereignty for member states. 
                    The UN's goal is to serve as a forum, rather than a intra-national governing body, a goal which has been lost sight of by many in the United States, who decry the UN as tyrannical while simultaneously inefficient. 
                    The Civic Party supports the UN and encourages active US participation in the UN, to ensure US interests are heard, and advocated for. Furthermore, we advocate working through the UN, and using the UN's Peacekeeping forces to stabilize anarchical countries and to intervene against genocidal regimes. 
                    International Law also serves the United States, as it ensures human rights worldwide. Therefore the US needs to comply with international law, as non-compliance only serves to weaken the American ethos, and does not serve to advance US military or foreign interests, on balance.
